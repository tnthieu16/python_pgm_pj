1. Information
The Vietnam Air Quality Data Series 2020 provides air quality values for several cities in Vietnam. Readers can access online data or historical data saved as of January 21, 2021 by zone GMT + 7

Attributes: Data attributes include: station name, O3 (μg / m³), PM2.5 (μg / m³), PM10 (μg / m³), CO (μg / m³), NO2 (μg / m³), SO2 ( μg / m³), location, province, city, update time, AQI indicator, reference link, dominent pollutant, pressure, humidity, temperature.

2. Scope of Analysis:
Descriptive Statistics: Basic statistics like mean, median, max, and min levels of pollutants.
Trend Analysis: Analysis over time to identify trends in pollutant levels.
Comparative Analysis: Compare pollution levels across different cities or regions within Vietnam.
Correlation Analysis: Identify any correlations between different pollutants.
Geospatial Analysis: Map the pollution levels to show geographic distribution (if geospatial data is available).

3. Project Execution Plan:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, incorrect data types, and removing duplicates.
Data Transformation: Creating new columns if necessary, e.g., categorizing pollutant levels as 'Low', 'Moderate', 'High'.
Visualization: Creating plots and possibly interactive maps to visually represent the data findings.
Insight Generation: Based on the analyses, derive insights about air quality trends and health implications.
Reporting: Prepare a final report or a presentation summarizing the methodology, analysis, and findings.

4. Output:
Data Visualizations: Charts, graphs, and maps.
Final Report or Presentation: Document detailing the entire process and findings.
Codebase: Well-documented Python code that can be reviewed or reused.
